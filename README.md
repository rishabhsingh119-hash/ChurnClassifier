# ChurnClassifier

## 📊 Project Overview
- End-to-end customer churn prediction and analysis
- Identifies key characteristics of customers likely to churn
- Uses insights from EDA to build predictive models

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb** - Model development and evaluation

## 🔍 Key Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering based on churn patterns
- Handles imbalanced dataset using SMOTEENN
- Multiple ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Performance evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Start with `Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb` for data exploration
3. Proceed to `Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb` for modeling

## 📈 Results
- Improved minority class (churned customers) prediction
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTEENN technique
- Focused on recall and F1-score rather than accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTEENN)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
